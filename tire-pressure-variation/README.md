# Tire Pressure Monitoring System Variation

[Requirements](https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/e0dccffff284511e736a53a59d853e31)

### Constraints.

Aside from its constructor this is the only public method of the `Alarm` class:

`check(): void`

`Alarm` cannot have any accessor methods to see its state, and all its fields must be private.

### Tools

[Use of test doubles with Prophecy and phpunit](https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/3c457d0c52ff2fcbbb3538b6cc79ddbd)
